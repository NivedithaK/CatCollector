# CatCollector

One day, your neighbour asks you to watch over their cats for an hour. However, they never specified how many cats
they had! When you enter their house, you notice a large plaque describing the challenge to become the next Cat Master.
Obviously, you take the challenge, and now you need to find and complete the missions of all the cats in the house. But
the cats are well-hidden and sometimes seem to disappear, so it's harder than you expected...

# Gameplay

All gameplay is based on keyboard input. Menu options are numbered, so you can enter the number corresponding to the 
action you want to take. Some tips:

  - Check locations more than once
  - Enjoy the cute cat pictures that pop up once you earn a Paw Print :)
  - The ASCII images are a little large so try to expand the window as much as possible

# Extensions

If this project is revisited, it can be improved by using object-oriented programming. One of the features I wanted to
add was a timer, but wasn't able to due to time constraints. For example, one minute in real life could represent 3 minutes
in the game, and since the house owner will return in 1 hour, the total gameplay would last for 20 minutes.
